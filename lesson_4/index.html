            <p>

            <q class="citate odd">We liked the idea of an international competition like the Hippo English Language Olympiad right away because it responds exactly to these characteristics: it brings students closer to the study of English by making them participate in an international competition open to all. Internationality is precisely the most important and innovative  stimulus because today it is essential to think more openly and allow children, even the youngest, to deal with cultures other than their own.</q>

            <q class="citate">How can one - in a few short sentences only - fully give credit to the priceless work that is being done at the Hippo English Language Olympiad and the invaluable results that come out of it? Having had the privilege to meet with students and fellow teachers in the Finals in Venice, my admiration for the activities being implemented grows bigger each time, and my respect gets more and more sincere. It has been a delight to work with such committed, open-minded people whose enthusiasm allows them to be swept up by the great competition.</q>

            <q class="citate odd">I can tell you, that nothing compares with the fulfillment when I see the sparkle in the finalists' eyes when they arrive to the Finals in Italy. What a wonderful concept this is, to gather children from all over the workd, in one place, to serve the same purpose of sharing the interest in the English language knowledge, meanwhile travelling, and seeing beautiful places.</q>

            <q class="citate">Hippo was our chance to assess their knowledge and our teaching by an external evaluation. We all were so excited about the competition and hoped that our experience would be positive, and fortunately, it really and truly was. The only thing better than the collection of Hippo staff were students and their teachers.</q>
